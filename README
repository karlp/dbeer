BarFinder

This was an android app that used OpenStreetMap data to show all nearby
bars/cafes/nightclubs and, if you were "in" (very close) to one, it allowed you
to enter the price of drinks.  The idea was that with enough crowdsourced data,
you could get actually reliable pricings, including detecting happy hours.
Existing custom city apps were always notoriously out of date on pricing, with
prices often entered by bar owners themselves, with no relationship to actual
prices at the bar.

The use of OpenStreetMap for the data was the other major benefit, as bars
close and open far more regularly than other businesses, and google location
data is/was appallingly low quality.  It would have high rankings for bars that
had closed, from old google juice, and was very slow to detect new bars.

The death of this project really came in Feb 2012, when the daily OpenStreetMap
export format changed, and I never quite got around to finding the time to
fixing the data import.
